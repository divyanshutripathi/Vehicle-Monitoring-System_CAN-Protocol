Predictive Analysis and Vehicle Monitoring System Using CAN Protocol 

Our aim is to provide a real-time Vehicle monitoring system. In this project, we are using CAN bus protocol to transfer the sensor data amidst two Cortex-M4 Controllers(STM32F407VGTx). This data is sent to Raspberry Pi for down-sampling using InfluxDB. The details are further sent to the cloud for Storage and Visualization on Grafana using RabbitMQ protocol. The user will get notifications regarding predictive maintenance on the Car Dashboard, which is designed using AngularJS.
